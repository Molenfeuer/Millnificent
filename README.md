# Mill-nificent

Adds an alternate building that looks more like a mill than the existing one

## Install

1. Download the newest version of this mod from NexusMods or the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/Nordmole/Millnificent/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP-File and put the folder into the mods folder of SMAPI (mostly located under "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Mods")

## Options

I'm sorry, but Solid Foundations (the Framework used by Mill-nificent) will not support configuration options in the foreseeable future. I hope the maintainer will add this functionality someday.

For those who absolutely want some options I will release a separate Content Patcher Mod in the future. Stay tuned!

If something doesn't work, or you miss a feature, feel free to open a new issue on the [GitHub Page of this mod](https://github.com/Nordmole/AlexMustacular/issues). I prefer the GitHub Page but if you really don't want to use it feel free to use the Issue Page here on NexusMods.

### DIY - Do it yourself 🖌️🎨

[Solid Foundations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12311) is a very powerful mod on many levels. One of its biggest advantages is its content pacher support. For those of you new to modding, this means you can easily create your own mod that overwrites some parts of Mill-nificent. For example the roof texture! Read [this guide](https://github.com/Floogen/AlternativeTextures/wiki/Content-Patcher-Integration) to understand how to do this! But please keep in mind that Mill-nificent also comes with alternative textures created by me (soon!)! Visit Robin's shop to see them :)

## Special

I'm not a windmill expert or something like that but they are a significant part of my childhoods region. Its pretty normal for me that every village has a big windmill near the city center. I think I know some really fancy mills and if you have time, stay a while and have a look at these beautiful mills:

- [Kinderdijk windmills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinderdijk_windmills)
- [Hüven Mill](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCvener_M%C3%BChle)
- [Molden Edens](https://www.visitwadden.nl/nl/bezoeken/activiteiten-overzicht/2559468064/molen-edens)
