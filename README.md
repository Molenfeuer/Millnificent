# Mill-nificent

Adds an alternate building that looks more like a mill than the existing one

## Install

1. Download the newest version of this mod from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16890) or the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/Molenfeuer/Millnificent/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP-File and put the folder into the mods folder of SMAPI (mostly located under "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Mods")

## Usage

You can buy this Mill in Robins [Carpenter's Shop](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Carpenter%27s_Shop) for the same price as the original ""mill"":

- 150x Wood ðŸªµ
- 50x Stone ðŸª¨
- 4x Cloth ðŸ§µ
- 2.500g ðŸª™

*Please note that during the placing of the mill it might seem that the mill is 7x2 tiles big. That is an limitation by the game (I guess). After Robin constructed your mill its area is only 3x2 tiles big (same as the original mill)*.

## Options

I'm sorry, but Solid Foundations (the Framework used by Mill-nificent) will not support configuration options in the foreseeable future. I hope the maintainer will add this functionality someday.

Available languages: ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

For those who want some alternative sprites, I have included skins created by other great artists and myself! If you've created your own skin for Millnificent and want to share it, please let me know!
