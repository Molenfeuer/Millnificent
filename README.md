# Mill-nificent

Adds an alternate building that looks more like a mill than the existing one

## Install

1. Download the newest version of this mod from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16890) or the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/Nordmole/Millnificent/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP-File and put the folder into the mods folder of SMAPI (mostly located under "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Mods")

## Usage

You can buy this Mill in Robins [Carpenter's Shop](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Carpenter%27s_Shop) for the same price as the original ""mill"":

- 150x Wood ü™µ
- 50x Stone ü™®
- 4x Cloth üßµ
- 2.500g ü™ô

*Please note that during the placing of the mill it might seem that the mill is 7x2 tiles big. That is an limitation by the game (I guess). After Robin constructed your mill its area is only 3x2 tiles big (same as the original mill)*.

## Options

I'm sorry, but Solid Foundations (the Framework used by Mill-nificent) will not support configuration options in the foreseeable future. I hope the maintainer will add this functionality someday.

For those who want some alternative sprites, a separate mod called [Millnificent Collab](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16931) has been released.

### DIY - Do it yourself üñåÔ∏èüé®

[Solid Foundations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12311) is a very powerful mod in many ways. One of its biggest advantages is its support for [Alternative Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9246). For those of you new to modding, this means that you can easily create your own mod that overwrites some parts of Mill-nificent. For example, the roof texture! Read [this guide](https://github.com/Floogen/AlternativeTextures/wiki/Creating-a-Content-Pack) to understand how to do it!

Some nice people and I have released [some fancy alternative styles for this mill](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16931)! You can use [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16931) as a base for your own modification of Mill-nificent!

## Special

I'm not a windmill expert or something like that but they are a significant part of my childhoods region. Its pretty normal for me that every village has a big windmill near the city center. I think I know some really fancy mills and if you have time, stay a while and have a look at these beautiful mills:
